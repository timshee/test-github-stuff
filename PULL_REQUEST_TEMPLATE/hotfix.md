# Solution
Write a brief on the solution's changes

EXAMPLE:

PROBLEM: action was missing `paginate` and not reading pagination from correct variable (was reading from `**kwargs` when it was already specified.

SOLUTION
- add pagination
- fix issues with Action's returned status by using `RestAPIRequestBaseAction`'s `get_action_status`
